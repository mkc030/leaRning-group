An important aspect of “writing data for computers” is to make your data
**tidy**. Key features of **tidy** data:

  - Each column is a variable
  - Each row is an observation

But unfortunately, **untidy** data abounds. In fact, we often inflict it
on ourselves, because untidy formats are more attractive for data entry
or examination. So how do you make **untidy** data **tidy**?

## Import untidy Lord of the Rings data

We now import the untidy data that was presented in the three
film-specific word count tables from [the intro](01-intro.md).

I assume that data can be found as three plain text, delimited files,
one for each film. How to liberate data from spreadsheets or tables in
word processing documents is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The files live here in this repo, which you could clone as a new RStudio
Project. Get them into your current project in a `data` subdirectory
with your favorite
    method:

  - [The\_Fellowship\_Of\_The\_Ring.csv](data/The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv)
  - [The\_Two\_Towers.csv](data/The_Two_Towers.csv)
  - [The\_Return\_Of\_The\_King.csv](data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv)

We bring the data into data frames or tibbles, one per film, and do some
inspection.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

#> Parsed with column specification:

#>   Female = col_integer(),
#>   Male = col_integer()
#> )
rking
#> # A tibble: 3 x 4
#>   Film                   Race   Female  Male
#>   <chr>                  <chr>   <int> <int>
#> 1 The Return Of The King Elf       183   510
#> 2 The Return Of The King Hobbit      2  2673
#> 3 The Return Of The King Man       268  2459
```

## Collect untidy Lord of the Rings data into a single data frame

We now have one data frame per film, each with a common set of 4
variables. Step one in tidying this data is to glue them together into
one data frame, stacking them up row wise. This is called row binding
and we use `dplyr::bind_rows()`.

``` r
lotr_untidy <- bind_rows(fship, ttow, rking)
str(lotr_untidy)
#> Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    9 obs. of  4 variables:
#>  $ Film  : chr  "The Fellowship Of The Ring" "The Fellowship Of The Ring" "The Fellowship Of The Ring" "The Two Towers" ...
#>  $ Race  : chr  "Elf" "Hobbit" "Man" "Elf" ...
#>  $ Female: int  1229 14 0 331 0 401 183 2 268
#>  $ Male  : int  971 3644 1995 513 2463 3589 510 2673 2459
lotr_untidy
#> # A tibble: 9 x 4
#>   Film                       Race   Female  Male
#>   <chr>                      <chr>   <int> <int>
#> 1 The Fellowship Of The Ring Elf      1229   971
#> 2 The Fellowship Of The Ring Hobbit     14  3644
#> 3 The Fellowship Of The Ring Man         0  1995
#> 4 The Two Towers             Elf       331   513
#> 5 The Two Towers             Hobbit      0  2463
#> 6 The Two Towers             Man       401  3589
#> 7 The Return Of The King     Elf       183   510
#> 8 The Return Of The King     Hobbit      2  2673
#> 9 The Return Of The King     Man       268  2459
```

Assembling one large data object from lots of little ones is common data
preparation task. When the pieces are as similar as they here, it’s nice
to assemble them into one object right away. In other scenarios, you may
need to do some remedial work on the pieces before they can be fitted
together nicely.

A good guiding principle is to glue the pieces together as early as
possible, because it’s easier and more efficient to tidy a single object
than 20 or 1000.

## Tidy the untidy Lord of the Rings data

We are still violating one of the fundamental principles of **tidy
data**. “Word count” is a fundamental variable in our dataset and it’s
currently spread out over two variables, `Female` and `Male`.
Conceptually, we need to gather up the word counts into a single
variable and create a new variable, `Gender`, to track whether each
count refers to females or males. We use the `gather()` function from
the tidyr package to do this.

``` r
lotr_tidy <-
  gather(lotr_untidy, key = 'Gender', value = 'Words', Female, Male)
lotr_tidy
#> # A tibble: 18 x 4
#>    Film                       Race   Gender Words
#>    <chr>                      <chr>  <chr>  <int>
#>  1 The Fellowship Of The Ring Elf    Female  1229
#>  2 The Fellowship Of The Ring Hobbit Female    14
#>  3 The Fellowship Of The Ring Man    Female     0
#>  4 The Two Towers             Elf    Female   331
#>  5 The Two Towers             Hobbit Female     0
#>  6 The Two Towers             Man    Female   401
#>  7 The Return Of The King     Elf    Female   183
#>  8 The Return Of The King     Hobbit Female     2
#>  9 The Return Of The King     Man    Female   268
#> 10 The Fellowship Of The Ring Elf    Male     971
#> 11 The Fellowship Of The Ring Hobbit Male    3644
#> 12 The Fellowship Of The Ring Man    Male    1995
#> 13 The Two Towers             Elf    Male     513
#> 14 The Two Towers             Hobbit Male    2463
#> 15 The Two Towers             Man    Male    3589
#> 16 The Return Of The King     Elf    Male     510
#> 17 The Return Of The King     Hobbit Male    2673
#> 18 The Return Of The King     Man    Male    2459
```

Tidy data … mission accomplished\!

To explain our call to `gather()` above, let’s read it from right to
left: we took the variables `Female` and `Male` and gathered their
*values* into a single new variable `Words`. This forced the creation of
a companion variable `Gender`, a *key*, which tells whether a specific
value of `Words` came from `Female` or `Male`. All other variables, such
as `Film`, remain unchanged and are simply replicated as needed. The
documentation for `gather()` gives more examples and documents
additional arguments.

## Write the tidy data to a delimited file

Now we write this multi-film, tidy dataset to file for use in various
downstream scripts for further analysis and visualization. This would
make an excellent file to share on the web with others, providing a
tool-agnostic, ready-to-analyze entry point for anyone wishing to play
with this data.

``` r
write_csv(lotr_tidy, path = file.path("data", "lotr_tidy.csv"))
```

You can inspect this delimited file here:
[lotr\_tidy.csv](data/lotr_tidy.csv).

## Exercises

The word count data is given in these two **untidy** and gender-specific
files:

  - [Female.csv](data/Female.csv)
  - [Male.csv](data/Male.csv)

Write an R script that reads them in and writes a single tidy data frame
to file. Literally, reproduce the `lotr_tidy` data frame and the
`lotr_tidy.csv` data file from above.

Write R code to compute the total number of words spoken by each race
across the entire trilogy. Do it two ways:

  - Using film-specific or gender-specific, untidy data frames as the
    input data.
  - Using the `lotr_tidy` data frame as input.

Reflect on the process of writing this code and on the code itself.
Which is easier to write? Easier to read?

Write R code to compute the total number of words spoken in each film.
Do this by copying and modifying your own code for totalling words by
race. Which approach is easier to modify and repurpose – the one based
on multiple, untidy data frames or the tidy data?

## Take home message

It is untidy to have have data parcelled out across different files or
data frames. We used `dplyr::bind_rows()` above to combine film-specific
data frames into one large data frame.

It is untidy to have a conceptual variable, e.g. “word count”, spread
across multiple variables, such as word counts for males and word counts
for females. We used the `gather()` function from the tidyr package to
stack up all the word counts into a single variable, create a new
variable to convey male vs. female, and do the replication needed for
the other variables.

Many data analytic projects will benefit from a script that marshals
data from different files, tidies the data, and writes a clean result to
file for further analysis.

Watch out for how **untidy** data seduces you into working with it more
than you should:

  - Data optimized for consumption by human eyeballs *is* attractive, so
    it’s hard to remember it’s suboptimal for computation. How can
    something that looks so pretty be so wrong?
  - Tidy data often has lots of repetition, which triggers hand-wringing
    about efficiency and aesthetics. Until you can document a
    performance problem, keep calm and tidy on.
  - Tidying operations are unfamiliar to many of us and we avoid them,
    subconsciously preferring to faff around with other workarounds that
    are more familiar.

### Where to next?

In the next lesson [03-spread](03-spread.md) I show to untidy data,
using `spread()` from the tidyr package. This might be useful at the end
of an analysis, for preparing figures or tables.

In the [optional bonus content](04-tidy-bonus-content.md), I show how to
tidy this data using only base R functions.
