This is a lesson on tidying data. Specifically, what to do when a conceptual variable is spread out over multiple data frames and across 2 or more variables in a data frame.

Data used: [words spoken](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr) by characters of different races and gender in the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy.

  * [01-intro](01-intro.md) shows untidy and tidy data. Then we demonstrate how tidy data is more useful for analysis and visualization. Includes references, resources, and exercises.
  * [02-gather](02-gather.md) shows __how__ to tidy data, using `gather()` from the `tidyr` package. Includes references, resources, and exercises.
  * [03-spread](03-spread.md) shows __how__ to untidy data, using `spread()` from the `tidyr` package. This might be useful at the end of an analysis, for preparing figures or tables.
  * [04-tidy-bonus-content](04-tidy-bonus-content.md) is not part of the lesson but may be useful as learners try to apply the principles of tidy data in more general settings. Includes links to packages used. *It is out of date!*
