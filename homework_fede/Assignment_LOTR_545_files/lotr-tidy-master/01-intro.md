An important aspect of “writing data for computers” is to make your data
**tidy**. Key features of **tidy** data:

  - Each column is a variable
  - Each row is an observation

If you are struggling to make a figure, for example, stop and think hard
about whether your data is **tidy**. Untidiness is a common, often
overlooked cause of agony in data analysis and visualization.

## Lord of the Rings example

I will give you a concrete example of some untidy data I created from
[this data from the Lord of the Rings
Trilogy](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr).

We have one table per movie. In each table, we have the total number of
words spoken, by characters of different races and genders.

You could imagine finding these three tables as separate worksheets in
an Excel workbook. Or hanging out in some cells on the side of a
worksheet that contains the underlying data raw data. Or as tables on a
webpage or in a Word document.

This data has been formatted for consumption by *human eyeballs*
(paraphrasing Murrell; see Resources). The format makes it easy for a
*human* to look up the number of words spoken by female elves in The Two
Towers. But this format actually makes it pretty hard for a *computer*
to pull out such counts and, more importantly, to compute on them or
graph them.

## Exercises

Look at the tables above and answer these questions:

  - What’s the total number of words spoken by male hobbits?
  - Does a certain `Race` dominate a movie? Does the dominant `Race`
    differ across the movies?

How well does your approach scale if there were many more movies or if I
provided you with updated data that includes all the `Races`
(e.g. dwarves, orcs, etc.)?

## Tidy Lord of the Rings data

Here’s how the same data looks in tidy form:

Notice that tidy data is generally taller and narrower. It doesn’t fit
nicely on the page. Certain elements get repeated alot, e.g. `Hobbit`.
For these reasons, we often instinctively resist **tidy** data as
inefficient or ugly. But, unless and until you’re making the final
product for a textual presentation of data, ignore your yearning to see
the data in a compact form.

## Benefits of tidy data

With the data in tidy form, it’s natural to *get a computer* to do
further summarization or to make a figure. This assumes you’re using
language that is “data-aware”, which R certainly is. Let’s answer the
questions posed above.

#### What’s the total number of words spoken by male hobbits?

``` r
## Cmd+Opt+P to run all chunks up til here
lotr_tidy %>% 
  count(Gender, Race, wt = Words)
#> # A tibble: 6 x 3
#>   Gender Race       n
#>   <chr>  <chr>  <int>
#> 1 Female Elf     1743
#> 2 Female Hobbit    16
#> 3 Female Man      669
#> 4 Male   Elf     1994
#> 5 Male   Hobbit  8780
#> 6 Male   Man     8043
## outside the tidyverse:
#aggregate(Words ~ Gender, data = lotr_tidy, FUN = sum)
```

Now it takes a small bit of code to compute the word total for both
genders of all races across all films. The total number of words spoken
by male hobbits is 8780. It was important here to have all word counts
in a single variable, within a data frame that also included a variables
for gender and
race.

#### Does a certain race dominate a movie? Does the dominant race differ across the movies?

First, we sum across gender, to obtain word counts for the different
races by movie.

``` r
(by_race_film <- lotr_tidy %>% 
   group_by(Film, Race) %>% 
   summarize(Words = sum(Words)))
#> # A tibble: 9 x 3
#> # Groups:   Film [?]
#>   Film                       Race   Words
#>   <fct>                      <chr>  <int>
#> 1 The Fellowship Of The Ring Elf     2200
#> 2 The Fellowship Of The Ring Hobbit  3658
#> 3 The Fellowship Of The Ring Man     1995
#> 4 The Two Towers             Elf      844
#> 5 The Two Towers             Hobbit  2463
#> 6 The Two Towers             Man     3990
#> 7 The Return Of The King     Elf      693
#> 8 The Return Of The King     Hobbit  2675
#> 9 The Return Of The King     Man     2727
## outside the tidyverse:
#(by_race_film <- aggregate(Words ~ Race * Film, data = lotr_tidy, FUN = sum))
```

We can stare hard at those numbers to answer the question. But even
nicer is to depict the word counts we just computed in a barchart.

``` r
p <- ggplot(by_race_film, aes(x = Film, y = Words, fill = Race))
p + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
```

![](01-intro_files/figure-gfm/barchart-lotr-words-by-film-race-1.png)<!-- -->

Hobbits are featured heavily in The Fellowhip of the Ring, where as Men
had a lot more screen time in The Two Towers. They were equally
prominent in the last movie, The Return of the King.

Again, it was important to have all the data in a single data frame, all
word counts in a single variable, and associated variables for Film and
Race.

## Take home message

Having the data in **tidy** form was a key enabler for our data
aggregations and visualization.

Tidy data is integral to efficient data analysis and visualization.

If you’re skeptical about any of the above claims, it would be
interesting to get the requested word counts, the barchart, or the
insight gained from the chart *without* tidying or plotting the data.
And imagine redoing all of that on the full dataset, which includes 3
more Races, e.g. Dwarves.

### Where to next?

In [the next lesson](02-gather.md), we’ll show how to tidy this data.

Our summing over gender to get word counts for combinations of film and
race is an example of **data aggregation**. It’s a frequent companion
task with tidying and reshaping. Learn more at:

    `dplyr::group_by()` + `dplyr::summarize()`, [STAT 545
